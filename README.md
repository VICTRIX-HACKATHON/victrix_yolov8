**SpaceBoot** is an AI-powered object detection system that ensures the presence of essential safety equipment in space stations or simulations. Using YOLOv8 and a Falcon space dataset, it identifies critical gear such as fire extinguishers, toolkits, and oxygen cylinders.


##  Features

-  Pre-trained model on Falcon's Space Station Dataset  
-  Fast inference with YOLOv8 architecture  
-  Web interface built with Flask for quick testing  
-  Simple and intuitive UI to upload or click images  


##  Web App Usage

1. Upload an image of a space station environment *(real or simulated)*  
2. Or test with built-in sample images  
3. The model will automatically detect safety equipment  
4. View detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores  


##  Model Details

- Trained on the **Falcon Space Station Dataset**  
- Detects:
  - ðŸ”§ Toolkits  
  - ðŸ§¯ Fire Extinguishers  
  - ðŸ§ª Oxygen Cylinders  
- Built on **YOLOv8**, optimized for high accuracy and speed  
- Lightweight enough for local deployment or edge testing
